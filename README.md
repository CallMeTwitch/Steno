Stenography - the action or process of writing in shorthand or taking dictation.

Stenography is often used in court to transcribe proceedings as they happen. The stenography keyboard uses combinations of keys to represent common words or phrases to increase the average typing speed from 40 wmp (words per minute) to between 200 and 240 wpms.

I wanted to become a faster typer so that I code could faster. Problem being- I'm lazy. So I created a Python program to replace key combinations with specified words/phrases, which took much less effort (not).

I've added a basic English and Python hotkey list, but feel free to make it your own. I also added some extra programmer functionality- if you add '@' in your output string, it'll place your cursor there after typing the hotkey.

I present, steno.
